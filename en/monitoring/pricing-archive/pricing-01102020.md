### Cost calculation example {#example}

Let's say you write to {{ monitoring-short-name }} 20 metrics at a rate of **1 value per minute**. In 30 days, your amount written will be:

> 20 metrics * 1 value/min * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 30 days = 864,000 values = 0.864 million values

The service cost for 30 days will be `0.864 million values * ₽7 = ₽6.05`.

If you write 20 metrics at a rate of **1 value per second**, in 30 days your total written will be:

> 20 metrics * 1 value/second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 30 days = 51,840,000 values = 51.84 million values

In this case, the service cost for 30 days will be `50 million values * ₽7 + (51.84 - 50) million values * ₽4 = ₽357.36`.
