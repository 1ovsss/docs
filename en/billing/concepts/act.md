# Reports

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can request [completion reports](##report-of-completion) and a [reconciliation report](#reconciliation-report). Reconciliation reports are available only for residents of the Russian Federation.

## Completion report {#report-of-completion}

A completion report is a primary accounting document confirming the provision of services. It contains aggregate data on the cost of the services actually provided. Detailed information about the services rendered is available on the [Usage details](../operations/check-charges.md) page.


### Creating a completion report {#create-act}

Reports are generated at the end of the reporting period for the amount actually spent from the [personal account](../concepts/personal-account.md) balance.

Reports are then used as a basis for generating [invoices](../concepts/invoice.md).
