* [{{ certificate-manager-full-name }}](../certificate-manager/pricing.md)
* [Yandex Cloud Console](../console/pricing.md)
* {{ preview-stage }} [{{ cloud-desktop-full-name }}](../cloud-desktop/pricing.md)

 Services at the [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage are tagged with {{ preview-stage }}.
