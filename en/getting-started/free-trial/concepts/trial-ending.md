# End of trial period


The trial period ends automatically when you use up the [grant](../../usage-grant.md) or when it expires.


Unless you upgraded to the paid version, access to your resources will be suspended for 60 days after the trial period ends:
* Your VM instances and DB clusters will be stopped.
* You will not be able to read or download any saved data.

You can restore access to your resources if you upgrade to the paid version within 60 days after the end of the trial period. Otherwise, all resources in your cloud will be permanently deleted.
