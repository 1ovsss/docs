To work with a Microsoft SQL Server data source:

1. Make sure your database can be accessed from the computer that Airbyte® is running on.
1. Create a dedicated Airbyte® user with read-only permissions and access to any tables that require replication.

For more information, see the [Airbyte® documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/mssql).
