If an organization with an activated support service plan uses resources paid from different billing accounts, the percentage portion of the plan cost will be charged to each billing account according to the cost of consumed resources, while only the account that was specified for this purpose when selecting the **Business** service plan pays the fixed portion. When you change the plan, you can choose a billing account for debiting the fixed portion of the plan. This option is only available to the organization owner. To change your billing account:
