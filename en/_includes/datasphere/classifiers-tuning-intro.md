In [{{ ml-platform-full-name }}]({{ link-datasphere-main }}), you can tune [classifiers](../../foundation-models/concepts/classifier/index.md) based on {{ yagpt-name }}. To do this, prepare [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded data for tuning in [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format with examples of texts and their relevant classes. The data structure in the examples will depend on the type of classification for which the model is trained.
