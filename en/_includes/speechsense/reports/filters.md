# Report filtering

You can use filtering to select the dialogs to include in your report. To do this, use the following settings:

* Period: Period of time for which the report is generated.
* Filters: Use the same fields as for the parameters.
* Grouping: Choose how to group data in your report. You can only group by metadata fields, e.g.:

   * By agent, to analyze the performance of each one.
   * By product, to learn which products agents make fewer mistakes presenting in conversations.

Data cross-sections depend on the recording metadata. For example, if you want to filter or group data by product, make sure there is a relevant field in the [metadata file](../../../speechsense/quickstart.md#set-space). If you need a new set of metadata, prepare conversation recordings with relevant metadata and [upload them](../../../speechsense/operations/data/upload-data.md).
