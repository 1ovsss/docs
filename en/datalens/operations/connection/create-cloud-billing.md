# Creating a {{ yandex-cloud }} Billing connection

You can only access statistics in the billing accounts where you have the `{{ roles-viewer }}`, `{{ roles-editor }}`, or `{{ roles-admin }}` role. For more information, refer to [Access management](../../../billing/security/index.md#primitive-roles).
Access to a billing account is granted to a user or service account [on the list of users](../../../billing/security/index.md#set-member-role) of the selected account. For more information, refer to the [detailed guide](../../../billing/security/index.md#set-role).
